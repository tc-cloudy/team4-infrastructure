## Repository Guidelines

This project contains 2 main branches and several feature branches.

The two main branches are: * master - (stable code) * development - the main pipe of Development

NOTE: Master branch is protected and merges are allowed only via pull request.

## Development Flow

Feature branches are created and used for every new feature defined in the backlog. Once the feature is completed, the code is reviewed by the rest of the developers and is merged back into the development branch once it is approved.

Once the feature is in development and it passes all the tests, a pull request is created for merging into master branch. Once the pull request is reviewed and approved by another team member, the code is then merged to master.

Example feature branch name: feature/vpc

Useful commands:
git clone <reponame>
git checkout -b <branchname>
git status
git diff
git add <files>
git commit -m "messsage"
git push

existing
git checkout <existingbranchname>
